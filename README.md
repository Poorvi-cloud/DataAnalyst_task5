🚢 Titanic EDA Project
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset, identifying key patterns and visual insights into passenger survival.

📑 Project Structure
task5.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the full EDA process.
train.csv, test.csv, gender_submission.csv: Dataset files used for analysis.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
1. Python
2. Pandas
3.NumPy
4.Matplotlib
5.Seaborn

🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights
Data Inspection: Using .info(), .describe(), .value_counts().

Visualizations:

1.Histograms of numeric features
2.Boxplots (Age vs Survived, Fare vs Survived)
3.Scatterplots (Fare vs Age)
4.Heatmap of feature correlations

Observations:

1.Younger passengers had better survival chances.
2.First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
3.Higher ticket fares were associated with better survival rates.
4.Most passengers traveled alone or with a small family.

📊 Key Findings

1.Socio-economic status (Pclass & Fare) heavily influenced survival.
2.Age and family size had moderate impact on survival probability.
3.Fare was positively correlated with survival, Pclass was negatively correlated.
4.Feature correlations provided helpful insight into the dataset for modeling.
